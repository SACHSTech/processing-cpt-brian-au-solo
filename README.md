# Program Title (edit this)

 KUNG FU FOOD! 
 A fruit-slicing game that involves two types of fruit and bombs. 
 
 To start the game, you must click on the start screen and you will be loaded into the game. You must get the highest score possible. You can do this by using your katana (mouse) to slice the apples and watermelon, while avoiding the bombs. Whenever the katana cuts, a katana slice animation will be displayed. For every apple cut, your score increases by 10. For every watermelon cut, your score increases by 20. If the fruit is not cut and falls below the screen, you will lose a life. If you lose all three lives, you will see the end screen and your final score. To play again, click on the end screen. Also, if you slice a bomb, the game will automically show the end screen with your final score.
